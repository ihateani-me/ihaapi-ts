api.ihateani.me but written in TypeScript

The website are originally written in Python with Sanic as it's backend.<br>
I'm creating this to actually try javascript and typescript.

This project is using [pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm)

Running:
- Without PM2: `pnpm run prod`
- With PM2: `pm2 start npm --no-automation --name ihaAPI -- run prod`
