		                           Version 2.0, January 2004
		                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
		
		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
		
		      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
		      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
		      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
		      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
		      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
		      identification within third-party archives.

		  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		  source, and configuration files.
		
		  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		  and conversions to other media types.
		
		  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

		  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

		  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		  subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		2\. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		  as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		  meet the following conditions:
		
		  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		      stating that You changed the files; and
		
		  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		      the Derivative Works; and
		
		  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		      as modifying the License.
		
		  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		  the conditions stated in this License.
		
		5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		  "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		  exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		  source, and configuration files.
		
		  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		  and conversions to other media types.
		
		  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

		  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

		  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		  subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		2\. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		  as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		  meet the following conditions:
		
		  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		      stating that You changed the files; and
		
		  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		      the Derivative Works; and
		
		  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		      as modifying the License.
		
		  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		  the conditions stated in this License.
		
		5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

		"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		2\. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
		
		You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
		
		You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
		
		If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
		
		5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
